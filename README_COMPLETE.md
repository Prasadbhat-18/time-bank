## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Storage Hierarchy
```
Priority 1: mockServices (in-memory, fastest)
Priority 2: localStorage (survives refresh)
Priority 3: permanentStorage (survives logout)
Priority 4: sharedStorage (survives browser restart)
Priority 5: Firebase (if enabled, survives everything)
```

### Real-Time Mechanism
```
Firebase Firestore:
‚îú‚îÄ Services collection ‚Üí Real-time listener
‚îú‚îÄ Chats collection ‚Üí Real-time listener
‚îú‚îÄ Messages subcollection ‚Üí Real-time listener
‚îî‚îÄ Bookings collection ‚Üí Real-time listener

When data changes:
1. Firebase detects change
2. Sends update to all connected clients
3. UI updates instantly
4. No page refresh needed
```

## üìä Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Service visibility | < 1 second |
| Chat message delivery | < 1 second |
| Typing indicator | < 500ms |
| Booking update | < 1 second |
| Page load | < 3 seconds |
| OTP delivery | 10-15 seconds |
