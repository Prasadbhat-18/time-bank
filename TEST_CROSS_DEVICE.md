## Troubleshooting

### Services Not Visible on Other Device?

**Check 1: Same Account?**
- Ensure you're logged in with the SAME account on both devices
- Different accounts won't see each other's services (by design)

**Check 2: Firebase Connected?**
```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for "‚òÅÔ∏è Service saved to Firebase"
4. If NOT present, Firebase might be disabled or not connected
```

**Check 3: Network Connection?**
- Both devices must be on same network (or internet)
- If on different networks, ensure app is deployed to internet (not localhost)

**Check 4: Cache Issue?**
```
1. On the device where service isn't visible:
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
3. Clear "All time" cache
4. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
5. Reload page
```

**Check 5: Firebase Credentials?**
1. Check `.env.local` has valid Firebase config
2. Verify Firestore is enabled in Firebase console
3. Check Firestore rules allow read/write

### Console Shows Firebase Error?

**Permission Denied Error:**
```
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Select your project
3. Go to Firestore Database
4. Check Rules tab
5. Ensure rules allow authenticated users to read/write
```

**Connection Error:**
```
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Firebase credentials in .env.local
3. Check if Firebase project is active
4. Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
```

## Advanced Testing

### Test 4: Persistence After Logout
1. Post a service on Laptop
2. Logout from Laptop
3. Login as DIFFERENT user on Laptop
4. Go to Services
5. ‚úÖ **Expected**: Service from first user still visible (from permanentStorage)

### Test 5: Real-Time Updates
1. Post service on Laptop
2. WITHOUT refreshing phone, wait 5 seconds
3. Go to Services on phone
4. ‚úÖ **Expected**: New service appears without refresh (real-time sync)

### Test 6: Multiple Services
1. Post 5 different services from laptop
2. View on phone
3. ‚úÖ **Expected**: All 5 services visible

### Test 7: Service Details
1. Post service with image from laptop
2. View on phone
