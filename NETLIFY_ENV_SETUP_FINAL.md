# Netlify Environment Variables Setup - FINAL FIX

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

The Netlify functions now support **both** variable name formats:
- `VITE_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` (what you already have)
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` (alternative format)

This means your existing credentials will work!

## ‚úÖ What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Netlify

Go to: https://app.netlify.com/

1. Select your site
2. Click **Site Settings** ‚Üí **Build & Deploy** ‚Üí **Environment**
3. Add these variables with your Twilio credentials:

| Variable Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `VITE_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Your Twilio Account SID |
| `VITE_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Your Twilio Auth Token |
| `VITE_TWILIO_SERVICE_SID` | Your Twilio Service SID |

### Step 2: Redeploy

1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click **Trigger deploy** ‚Üí **Deploy site**
3. Wait for "Published" status (2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Test

1. Go to your website
2. Hard refresh: **Ctrl+Shift+R**
3. Open DevTools: **F12**
4. Go to **Console** tab
5. Try phone login
6. Look for: `‚úÖ Real Twilio server confirmed - ready to send SMS`

## üìù What Changed in Code

**Netlify Functions Updated:**
- `netlify/functions/send-otp.ts` - Now reads both `TWILIO_*` and `VITE_TWILIO_*` variables
- `netlify/functions/verify-otp.ts` - Now reads both `TWILIO_*` and `VITE_TWILIO_*` variables
- `netlify/functions/health.ts` - Now reads both `TWILIO_*` and `VITE_TWILIO_*` variables

**Key Improvement:**
```typescript
// Before: Only looked for TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
const accountSid = process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID;

// After: Looks for both TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID and VITE_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
const accountSid = process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID || process.env.VITE_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID;
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables added to Netlify
- [ ] Site redeployed (Published status)
- [ ] Browser cache cleared (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Phone login attempted
- [ ] Console shows "‚úÖ Real Twilio server confirmed"
- [ ] SMS received on phone

## üéØ Expected Result

After redeploy, OTP should work perfectly:
1. User enters phone number
2. SMS is sent via Twilio
3. User receives OTP code
4. User enters OTP and logs in successfully

## ‚ùå If Still Not Working

Check Netlify Function Logs:
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Click **Functions** tab
3. Click **send-otp**
4. Look at the logs - they will show which variables are set

## üîê Security Note

Never commit `.env` files to git. The credentials you provided are already in your `.gitignore` file, so they won't be exposed.
