   - For trial accounts, only verified numbers can receive SMS

### 🔧 Step 1: Get Twilio Credentials

1. **Login to Twilio Console**: https://console.twilio.com/
2. **Get Account SID & Auth Token**:
   - Go to Dashboard → Account Info
   - Copy `Account SID` and `Auth Token`

3. **Create Verify Service**:
   - Go to Verify → Services
   - Click "Create new Service"
   - Name it "TimeBank OTP"
   - Copy the `Service SID`

### 📝 Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Copy the example file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env` file** with your Twilio credentials:
   ```env
   # Twilio Configuration
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
   TWILIO_SERVICE_SID=VAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   
   # Server Configuration
   PORT=4000
   ```

### 📱 Step 3: Verify Your Phone Number (IMPORTANT!)

**For Twilio Trial Accounts:**
1. Go to Phone Numbers → Manage → Verified Caller IDs
2. Click "Add a new number"
3. Enter your phone number with country code (e.g., +919876543210)
4. Verify via SMS or call

**Note**: Trial accounts can only send SMS to verified numbers!

### 🚀 Step 4: Start the Real SMS Server

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the REAL SMS server**:
   ```bash
   node start-real-sms.js
   ```

3. **Verify server is running**:
   - You should see: "✅ Twilio configuration loaded successfully"
   - Server runs on http://localhost:4000

### 🧪 Step 5: Test SMS Delivery

1. **Open your TimeBank app**
2. **Go to Phone Login**
3. **Enter your phone number** (with country code: +919876543210)
4. **Click "Send OTP"**
5. **Check your phone** for the SMS

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

#### ❌ "OTP server is not responding"
- **Solution**: Start the server with `node start-real-sms.js`
- **Check**: Server should show "✅ Twilio configuration loaded successfully"

#### ❌ "Twilio not configured properly"
- **Solution**: Check your `.env` file has correct credentials
- **Verify**: All three values (Account SID, Auth Token, Service SID) are set

#### ❌ "Phone number must include country code"
- **Solution**: Use format +919876543210 (not 9876543210)
- **India**: +91 followed by 10-digit number
- **US**: +1 followed by 10-digit number

#### ❌ SMS not received
- **Trial Account**: Ensure your phone number is verified in Twilio Console
- **Check Logs**: Look for "✅ Real SMS OTP sent successfully" in server logs
- **Twilio Logs**: Check Twilio Console → Monitor → Logs for delivery status

#### ❌ "Permission denied" or "Invalid credentials"
- **Solution**: Double-check your Twilio credentials in `.env`
- **Regenerate**: Create new Auth Token in Twilio Console if needed

### 📊 Server Logs to Look For
