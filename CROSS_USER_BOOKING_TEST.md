# Cross-User Service Booking Test Instructions

## Problem Fixed:
- Gmail users can now book services from other Gmail users 
- Own services are properly grayed out and cannot be booked
- Consistent user ID generation for Gmail accounts
- Services persist across different login sessions

## Test Steps:

### 1. Create a service with one Gmail account:
1. Go to http://localhost:5174/
2. Login with: `test1@gmail.com` / `password123`
3. Navigate to "Services" tab
4. Click "Post Service" 
5. Create a service (e.g., "React Tutoring", "Web Development Help")
6. Click "Create Service"
7. Logout

### 2. Try to book from another Gmail account:
1. Login with: `test2@gmail.com` / `password123` 
2. Navigate to "Services" tab
3. You should see the service created by test1@gmail.com
4. Click "Book Now" - this should work now!
5. You should also see a "Chat First" button to discuss terms

### 3. Verify own services are grayed out:
1. Login with: `test1@gmail.com` / `password123`
2. Navigate to "Services" tab  
3. Your own service should be:
   - Grayed out (reduced opacity)
   - Show "Your Service" badge
   - Have "Your Service" button instead of "Book Now"
   - Show "Cannot book own service" text

## Debug Info:

- Cross-user booking validation is in place

## Fixed Issues:
