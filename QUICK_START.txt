╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 1: GET TWILIO CREDENTIALS (5 minutes)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/
2. Get these three values:
   • Account SID (starts with AC)
   • Auth Token
   • Verify Service SID (starts with VA)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 2: CREATE SERVER/.ENV FILE (2 minutes)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Create file: server/.env

Add these lines (replace with your credentials):

  TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  TWILIO_SERVICE_SID=VAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  PORT=4000
  NODE_ENV=development

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 3: START THE APP (1 minute)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Run this command:

  npm start

Wait for output:

  ✅ ALL SYSTEMS READY ✅
  🌐 App:    http://localhost:5173
  📱 Server: http://localhost:4000

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 STEP 4: TEST ALL FEATURES (5 minutes)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ TEST 1: OTP Phone Login
  1. Go to http://localhost:5173
  2. Click "Phone" tab
  3. Enter phone: +91XXXXXXXXXX
  4. Click "Send OTP"
  5. Check phone for SMS (10-15 seconds)
  6. Enter code and verify ✅

✅ TEST 2: Cross-User Services
  1. Login as User A
  2. Post a service
  3. Logout
  4. Login as User B
  5. Go to "Browse Services"
  6. See User A's service ✅

✅ TEST 3: Service Persistence
  1. Post a service
  2. Close browser completely
  3. Reopen browser
  4. Login as different user
  5. Service still visible ✅

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 WHAT'S FIXED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ ISSUE 1: OTP Not Working
   → Fixed! OTP server auto-starts with npm start
   → Real SMS sent via Twilio (not mock)
   → Works in 10-15 seconds

✅ ISSUE 2: Cross-User Service Visibility
   → Fixed! User A's services visible to User B
   → Services loaded from all storage sources
   → Instant visibility across users

✅ ISSUE 3: Service Persistence
   → Fixed! Services persist across browser restarts
   → Services saved to 4 storage locations
   → Services stay until deleted by user/admin

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 USEFUL COMMANDS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Start everything (recommended):
  npm start

Start app only (if server already running):
  npm start:app-only

Build for production:
  npm run build

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 TROUBLESHOOTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OTP not sending?
  → Check server/.env has all Twilio credentials
  → Verify credentials are correct from console.twilio.com
  → Run npm start (not npm run dev)

Services not visible to other users?
  → Try refreshing the page
  → Check browser console for errors
  → Make sure both users are logged in

Services disappearing?
  → Try different browser
  → Clear browser cache
  → Check DevTools → Application → Storage
