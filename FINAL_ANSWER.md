## 🏗️ How This Works Behind The Scenes

### Technology Stack
```
Frontend (React):
├─ Phone app (Vite + React)
├─ Laptop app (Vite + React)
└─ Tablet app (Vite + React)

Backend (Firebase):
├─ Firestore Database (stores all data)
├─ Real-time Listeners (watch for changes)
├─ Authentication (manages users)
└─ Cloud Storage (stores images)

Real-Time Mechanism:
├─ When User A posts service
├─ Firebase detects change
├─ Sends update to all connected clients
├─ User B's phone receives update
├─ User C's tablet receives update
└─ All devices update UI instantly
```

### Real-Time Listeners (Already Implemented)
```javascript
// Services - Real-time updates
firebaseService.subscribeToServices((services) => {
  // Called instantly when any service changes
  updateUI(services);
});

// Chat Messages - Real-time updates
chatService.subscribeMessages(chatId, (messages) => {
  // Called instantly when new message arrives
  displayMessages(messages);
});

// Bookings - Real-time updates
bookingNotificationService.subscribeToProviderBookings(providerId, (booking) => {
  // Called instantly when new booking created
  notifyProvider(booking);
});
```
