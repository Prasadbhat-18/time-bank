## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP SETUP

### Step 1: Get Twilio Credentials

1. Go to **https://console.twilio.com/**
2. Sign up or log in
3. Find these in your console:
   - **Account SID** (starts with `AC`)
   - **Auth Token** (long string)
   - **Verify Service SID** (starts with `VA`)
   - **Twilio Phone Number** (optional, for distress messages)

### Step 2: Create server/.env File

Create a file called `.env` in the `server` folder:

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_SERVICE_SID=VAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Replace the values with your actual Twilio credentials!**

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### Step 4: Start Everything

**Option A: Using npm (Recommended)**
```bash
npm start
```

**Option B: Windows Batch File**
Double-click `start-all.bat`

**Option C: PowerShell**
```powershell
.\start-all.ps1
```

## 📱 Testing Phone Login

1. Keep the server running
2. Go to http://localhost:5173
3. Click "Phone" tab on login
4. Enter phone number with country code: **+919876543210**
5. Click "Send Code"
6. **You should receive SMS within 10 seconds**
7. Enter the code from SMS
8. Click "Sign in"

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Twilio not configured"

**Check:**
1. Is `server/.env` file created?
2. Are all three credentials filled in?
3. Did you save the file?

**Fix:**
```bash
cd server
# Create .env file with your credentials
# Then restart: npm start
```

### Error: "Failed to send OTP"

**Possible causes:**
1. Phone number format wrong (needs `+` and country code)
2. Twilio account has no credits
3. Twilio Service SID is incorrect
4. Phone number is blocked by Twilio

**Fix:**
- Try a different phone number
- Check Twilio account balance
- Verify credentials in console

### SMS not received

**Check:**
1. Phone number has country code: `+91` for India
2. Phone number is correct
3. Twilio account is active
4. Check spam folder

**Fix:**
- Wait 10-15 seconds for SMS
- Try again with different number
- Check Twilio logs in console

### Server won't start

**Check:**
1. Is port 4000 already in use?
2. Are dependencies installed?
3. Is Node.js installed?

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check if port is in use
netstat -ano | findstr :4000

# Kill process if needed (Windows)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Reinstall dependencies
cd server
npm install
npm start
```
