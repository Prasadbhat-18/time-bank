# ðŸ”§ Git Deployment Branch Setup

## Create Netlify-Ready Deployment Branch

Follow these steps to create a separate git branch for Netlify deployment:

---

## Step 1: Create Deployment Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b netlify-deployment

# Or if you want to create from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b netlify-deployment
```

---

## Step 2: Verify Code Status

```bash
# Check git status
git status

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -5
```

---

## Step 3: Ensure .gitignore is Correct

Your `.gitignore` should include:

```
# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

# Dependencies
node_modules/
dist/
dist-server/

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
```

---

## Step 4: Add Deployment Files

These files are already created:
- âœ… `.env.example` - Environment template
- âœ… `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Deployment instructions
- âœ… `GIT_DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md` - This file

---

## Step 5: Commit Changes

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "chore: prepare for Netlify deployment

- All features tested and working
- Emergency contacts fully functional
- XP system fixed and updating
- Login methods working (Google, Phone, Email)
- SOS distress messaging implemented
- Chat with AI enhancement ready
- Service marketplace complete
- Booking system fully operational"
```

---

## Step 6: Push to Remote

```bash
# Push branch to GitHub
git push origin netlify-deployment

# Or set upstream
git push -u origin netlify-deployment
```

---

## Step 7: Verify on GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Branches"
3. Verify `netlify-deployment` branch exists
4. Check all commits are there

---

## Step 8: Connect to Netlify

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/
2. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
3. Select GitHub
4. Choose your repository
5. Select `netlify-deployment` branch
6. Configure build settings (see NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
7. Add environment variables
8. Deploy!

---

## Keeping Branches Synced

### Update deployment branch with latest main:

```bash
# Switch to main and pull latest
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Switch to deployment branch
git checkout netlify-deployment

# Merge main into deployment
git merge main

# Push updated deployment branch
git push origin netlify-deployment
```

---

## Branch Naming Convention

- **main** - Production-ready code
- **netlify-deployment** - Netlify deployment branch
- **develop** - Development branch (if needed)
- **feature/*** - Feature branches

---

## Deployment Workflow

```
